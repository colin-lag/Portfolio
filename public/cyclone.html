            <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
            <p>January - June 2020</p>
            <p>Collaborators: <a class="project-name-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandreberkovic/">Alexandre Berkovic</a>, Brandon Tan, Natasha Cowans </p>
            <p>The task of this project was to create a handheld battery powered device for an underserved user group. Our team decided to work with visually impaired users, and through interviews and discussion decided to create a hair styling product that would tackle the issues encountered by our users.</p>

          <h2>ADAPTING TO THE USER BASE</h2>
          <p>Through research into both the habits of visually impaired users and the user interaction with traditional hair curlers, some <b>key issues</b> and <b>insights</b> became apparent. The main issues of available products are the <b>risk of burns</b> due to the exposed heated rod, the<b> risk of tangling </b>with motorised curlers, <b>lack of feedback</b> before, during and after use, finally the overall <b>expensive</b> nature of products specifically designed for “disabled” users. The major insights obtained through research were the importance of <b>sensory clues</b> for visually impaired users (haptic, audio but also visual as most visually impaired users can still distinguish flashing lights), as well as the<b> potential for new products </b>in the hair styling market due to the overall negative appeal of traditional curling irons.</p>

            <p class="project-text-split">10L of air are sucked in from the bottom by a centrifugal pump every second and is guided into the handle by the volute chamber. A brushless DC motor rotates the impeller at a rate de 8,000 RPM to obtain this flow. In the handle is a 422W nichrome-mica heating element encased in an acrylic shell, which heats up the air up to 65°C. The acrylic shell reduces the loss of heat to the handle and ensures safe extended use. The air then goes through an airflow separator which can change the direction of the air depending on the chosen setting. Finally, the air is guided at a 12° downward slant into the main tube, where it creates a vortex guiding the hair. As the product was destined to be both portable and battery powered, energy use was a crucial issue and a balance of battery capacity and weight was obtained using multiple 26650 batteries. This delivers a half hour of battery life, which was determined to be enough for every user interviewed.</p>

          <h2>SENSORY CUES</h2>
          <p>To ensure ease of use for the user, several elements have been implemented. Firstly, the integration of a vocal assistant relying on the Alexa API and the creation of personalized hooks. This adds an extra layer of security for the user to ensure the product is turned off and can monitor usage. Secondly, to make use of the crucial residual sight of the visually impaired users, an LED ring at the bottom indicates the direction of the air flow, while an LED button helps the user easily find it. Finally, a piezoelectric speaker gives the user timing cues to ensure the hair is not burned due to a prolonged exposure to the heated air.</p>

        <p>A requirement of this project was to identify a brand that could offer this product among their range of products and design in to fit. Our team decided to choose Panasonic due to their connection to the hair care market as well as their technologically innovative product line. This project was not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Panasonic. The name Panasonic as well as related names, marks, emblems and images are registered trademarks of their respective owners.</p>
