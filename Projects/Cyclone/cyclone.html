            <p>January - June 2020</p>

            <p>The task of this project was to create a handheld battery powered device for an underserved user group. Our team decided to work with visually impaired users, and through interviews and discussion decided to create a hair styling product that would tackle the issues encountered by our users.</p>

          <h2>ADAPTING TO THE USER BASE</h2>
          <p>Through research into both the habits of visually impaired users and the user interaction with traditional hair curlers, some <b>key issues</b> and <b>insights</b> became apparent. The main issues of available products are the <b>risk of burns</b> due to the exposed heated rod, the<b> risk of tangling </b>with motorised curlers, <b>lack of feedback</b> before, during and after use, finally the overall <b>expensive</b> nature of products specifically designed for “disabled” users. The major insights obtained through research were the importance of <b>sensory clues</b> for visually impaired users (haptic, audio but also visual as most visually impaired users can still distinguish flashing lights), as well as the<b> potential for new products </b>in the hair styling market due to the overall negative appeal of traditional curling irons.</p>
